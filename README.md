# pyprojectMSE110
AHHHHHH, I didn't realize this was a thing until very recently (still working on HW 11 by the way)
the DS file sorts materials based on density when given a chemical system
the CD file distributes crystal strucuters based on material family (this one has a lot of allowed inputs because "material family" is really vague)
I'm tired. 
I was too busy writing this so I didn't get to eat dinner. I hope I wake up early enough for breakfast tommorrow (does tommorrow have one m or two m's?)
Have a great summer!
